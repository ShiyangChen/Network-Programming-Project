# Network-Programming-Project
This project consists of three sub projects

Built a virtual chat room consisting of an iterative server and multithreaded clients following Simple Broadcast 

Chat Protocol (SBCP). The chat room allows clients to join and leave a global chat session, view the members, send 

and receive messages.

The server allows upload and download of files in the local directory from where the server is executed.

in LRU fashion.
